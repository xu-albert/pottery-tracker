# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pottery Tracker is a photo-first mobile app for hobby potters to log and track their ceramic pieces. The full product requirements are in `pottery_tracker_prd.md`.

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (local-only) is implemented.** Firebase sync is Phase 2.

### What's built:
- Sign-in screen (Google/Apple buttons + "Skip for now") — UI gate only, no Firebase backend
- Album screen with 3-column grid, search bar, All/Finished filter chips, empty state
- Piece creation: tap + → bottom sheet (Camera/Photo Library) → compress & save photo → create piece in DB → navigate to detail
- Piece detail: swipeable photo gallery, metadata form (title, stage, clay type, glazes, notes), "Last updated" timestamp, add photo, delete photo (long press), delete piece (overflow menu), "Done" button
- Fullscreen photo viewer with pinch-zoom
- Settings: account info, sign out, sync placeholder, support developer placeholder, version
- Localization: all strings in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
- Drift (SQLite) database with Pieces and Photos tables + DAOs
- Riverpod state management throughout
- GoRouter with StatefulShellRoute for bottom nav + auth redirect

### Known decisions:
- Cover photo / thumbnail selection UI removed — will be reworked later. Currently auto-sets most recent photo as cover.
- Image pipeline uses in-memory compression (`compressWithList`) with raw-bytes fallback for reliability
- Camera crashes on iOS simulator — use Photo Library for testing

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter 3.41.0 (Dart 3.11.0)
- **Local DB:** Drift (SQLite via `drift` + `drift_flutter`)
- **State Management:** Riverpod (`flutter_riverpod`)
- **Routing:** GoRouter (`go_router`)
- **Image handling:** `image_picker`, `flutter_image_compress`, `exif`
- **Auth (UI only):** `google_sign_in`, `sign_in_with_apple`
- **Cloud:** Firebase — not wired up yet (Phase 2)

### Data Model

Two core entities with a one-to-many relationship:

- **Piece** — (id, title, stage, clayType, glazes, notes, coverPhotoId, createdAt, updatedAt)
- **Photo** — (id, pieceId FK, localPath, thumbnailPath, cloudUrl, dateTaken, createdAt, sortOrder)

Stage is an enum: `greenware | bisqued | glazed` (all optional).

### Image Pipeline

Photos go through: `image_picker` → `readAsBytes()` → `FlutterImageCompress.compressWithList()` → `File.writeAsBytes()`. Main image: JPEG q75 max 1500px. Thumbnail: JPEG q60 max 300px. Falls back to raw bytes if compression fails. Saved to `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()/photos/{pieceId}/{photoId}.jpg`.

### Offline-First + Cloud Sync

All data lives in local SQLite first. Firebase sync happens opportunistically when connectivity is available (Phase 2). Conflict resolution is last-write-wins based on `updatedAt`.

### Navigation

Bottom navigation with 3 tabs: Home (album grid), + (opens create flow), Settings. GoRouter with `StatefulShellRoute`. Auth redirect sends unauthenticated users to sign-in.

## Design Constraints

- All features must work fully offline; sync is additive
- English only for V1 but use Flutter intl (no hardcoded strings)
- V1 is free with optional donation — no paywalls
- Firebase Spark (free) plan: 1GB Firestore, 5GB Cloud Storage, 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- Accessibility: screen reader support, system font scaling, minimum touch targets (48dp Android / 44pt iOS)
